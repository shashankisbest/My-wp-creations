            <h1 style="color: rgb(18, 184, 249);">Main Character STEVE</h1>
            <p>
                Steve, the default player character in Minecraft, is the embodiment of adventure and creativity. With his signature blue shirt, square jaw, and determined gaze, he’s a blank canvas for endless possibilities. Whether mining deep underground, building sky-high castles, or battling dangerous mobs, Steve represents the fearless spirit of exploration and the joy of crafting something from nothing in a blocky world full of wonder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though Steve may seem simple at first glance, he’s a symbol of resilience and adaptability. Armed with nothing but his fists at the start, he can craft tools, tame wild animals, and face off against dragons with grit and ingenuity. Steve is every player, ready to take on whatever challenges the world throws at him. From planting a single seed to building sprawling empires, his journey is a testament to the power of imagination—and the strength it takes to punch trees into planks.
