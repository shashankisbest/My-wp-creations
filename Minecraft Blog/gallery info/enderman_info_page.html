            <p>
                Endermen are neutral mobs in Minecraft known for their mysterious behavior 
                and ability to teleport. They are tall, dark, and unsettling creatures with glowing purple eyes, 
                often found in the Overworld, the Nether, and the End. Players should be cautious not to make eye 
                contact with an Enderman, as this will provoke them into attacking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Endermen are fascinating creatures in Minecraft lore. They are believed to have connections 
                to ancient builders and hold secrets about the game's universe. Despite their intimidating 
                nature, they are often farmed by players for their Ender Pearls, a vital item for crafting 
                and transportation.
